This repository contains a custom-built agentic AI framework that demonstrates how to design, implement, and run an intelligent, autonomous AI agent without relying on prebuilt agent libraries.

The project follows a clean agent architecture consisting of an Agent core, States, Skills, and Policies, enabling dynamic decision-making, tool selection, memory, and robustness.
